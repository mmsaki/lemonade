* How did the idea for the Lemonade, Inc come about?
    * **Daniel Schreiber** started Lemonade, inc. to improve the relationship between a customer and an insurance company which is often very cumbersome and slow. 
    <a name="4">[4]</a> Schreiber did not know much about insurance.
     He met this problem head on by pouring its funds, talents and behavioural science expertise into developing two world-class chatbots that completely shatter category norms.

> <a name="3">*[3]*</a> *It’s not a natural thing for a tech entrepreneur to want to go into insurance, it connotes all the wrong things. It’s perceived as being dull, as being retro-grade, heavily regulated, heavily capital intensive but myself and my co-founder Shai Wininger were a little contrarian when it comes to that. The very fact that it was so off pudding made it kind of interesting. - Daniel Schreiber during interview with David Gogel.* 



* How is Lemonade, Inc funded and How much funding have they received?
    * Lemonade has raised a total of $481.5M in funding over 14 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jul 2, 2020 from a Post-IPO Equity round. <a name="2">[2]</a>

## 3. ✍️ **Business Activities**
* What specific financial problem is Lemonade, Inc trying to solve? 
    * <a name="8">[8]</a> Traditional insurance companies simply make a profit by denying claims, they earn more money. 
    Lemonade aims to transform the insurance industry by taking a different approach. 
    When customers sign up for a Lemonade pet insurance policy, they take a flat fee, which is how they grow and support their company. 
    The remaining premiums are used to pay out claims.
     If there’s money left over, it goes directly to a social cause chosen by each customer. 
     This changes the nature of their relationship with their policyholders and builds trust. 
        * As a tech company doing insurance, Lemonade is constantly updating and expanding our products. Since the launch in 2015, they expanded and built a variety of packages and offerings in what they consider one of the most customizable options for pet owners. Whether it’s their preventative care package designed specifically for puppies and kittens, or their physical therapy add-on to support those that need a little extra care, various options are available so customers can have pet health insurance that is personalized to their needs.
* Who is the Lemonade's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
    * Life insurance, Pets insurance, Car insurance, Renter's and Home Owners insurance. 
* What solution does Lemonade offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?
    -  🦾 AI Technologies. Lemonade is a full stack insurance company offering homeowners + renters insurance powered by AI, behavioral economics, and social good. <a name="5">[5]</a> 
        * **Maya**, *the sign-up bot*, is available 24/7 and can have the average new customer signed up in under a minute. 
        * **Jim**, *the claims bot*, makes Maya look slow, regularly settling claims in under three seconds. 
     This includes cross referencing the claim against the relevant policy, running over a dozen anti-fraud algorithms, approving the claim, sending wiring instructions to the appropriate bank and notifying the customer of the good news. 
     All in under three seconds. <a name="7">[7]</a>
        * **CX.AI** is a bot platform built to understand and instantly resolve customer requests without human intervention. About 30% of all customer inquiries are currently handled this way. Customers often require assistance pre- or post-purchase, ranging from coverage questions to making changes to their policy, such as adding a spouse, updating coverage amounts, changing payment methods, or adding newly purchased items. 
        CX.AI uses Natural Language Processing to analyze and understand customers' requests, helping them perform a growing set of tasks. <a name="1">[1]</a>

    * **INNOVATION ENABLES NEW RISKS TO BE COVERED**

    * **VENTURE CAPITAL**
        * Capital management companies have quickly graduated over past years from where insurtech was noted as a growing opportunity to the place where venture capital firms are building large portfolios to fund and incubate new innovations.

    * **PICTURES ARE WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS**
        * With smartphone technology embedding high resolution cameras and machine learning being able to discern information, technology surrounding cameras and images was front and center. Claims for personal auto property damage using cameras was part of several concepts, as well as the growing use of satellite imagery for examining and underwriting properties, assessing roofs for underwriting and using time-lapse satellite imagery to assess claims damage during catastrophic storms.
    * **DATA-DRIVEN ASPECTS OF INSURANCE**
        * The world of collecting new data sources for use in insurance analytics continues to get larger all the time. 
        * Simpler demographic data is still important, but the addition of unstructured data such written documentation, images, audio, video and social media is quickly becoming involved in new ways to look at a customer or a risk.
    * **THE CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE**
        * As insurance evolves with more emphasis on technology, expanding and enhancing the customer experience is a growing trend. 
        * Insurance distributors, the underwriting process, in force policy management and the claims experience all have technology angles that are coming further into focus.
    * **COMPETITIVE PRESSURE FROM NEW PLAYERS**
